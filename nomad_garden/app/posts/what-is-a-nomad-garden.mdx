# What is a Nomad Garden?

> "This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment

> potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight,
> experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out
> continuums of intensities segment buy segment, **have a small plot of new
> land at all times**"
