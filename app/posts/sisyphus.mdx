# Sonnet for Sisyphus 

From past my stone I see the path up to the mountain peak.  
With heart as heavy as my burden I continue on.  
But even when the top is reached my task is not complete,  
for once the trail has ended all my progress will be gone.  

Amidst the fields of purgatory I will start again.  
I'll roll my boulder up the mountain as I have before.  
Then to the base I'll watch it fall. The cycle has no end.  
Tis' what I do for all the worldly sins I'm paying for.  

But all my repetition gives me quite some time to think,  
and focus on erosion where my feet and ground collide.  
With every pass I make, by just a bit, the hill will shrink,  
until I push my stone across a prairie, open wide.  

I'll dig my heels and carve a path right through this wretched hill,  
and grind it down until my rock and I can both be still.
