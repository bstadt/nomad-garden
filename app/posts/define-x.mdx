# Define x

Before we can approach the task of defining x, we must first understand the nature of definition itself.
The quest to define and categorize the world around us has been a cornerstone of Western philosophical thought since antiquity.
This pursuit can be traced back to Plato's dialogues, where the Socratic method was used to repeatedly probe the boundaries and essence of concepts through rigorous definition.
The Platonic tradition established a framework where philosophical inquiry centered on capturing the true nature of things through precise definition, seeking to identify the essential qualities that make a thing what it is.

However, this approach faced immediate challenges.
The famous anecdote of Diogenes responding to Plato's definition of a human as a "featherless biped" by presenting a plucked chicken illustrates a fundamental problem: purely formal definitions often fail to capture the full essence of what they seek to define.
The problem of extensional adequacy, the inability of succinct definitions to completely capture intuitive meaning, would continue to haunt philosophical attempts at definition for millennia, eventually spurring the development of modern logic.

Gottlob Frege approached the problem of extensional adequacy through mathematical rigor.
He developed predicate logic to express meaning with unprecedented precision.
His system attempted to escape the ambiguities of natural language by reducing meaning to computable mathematical expressions.
His student Bertrand Russell built upon this foundation by developing type theory and the theory of descriptions to handle complex cases.
However, Russell's work uncovered a deeper problem.
The very notion of formal mathematical definition collapsed when applied to concepts like "the set of all sets that don't contain themselves."
This revelation sparked a crisis in the foundations of mathematics and logic, fundamentally challenging the possibility of complete formal systems of definition.

It was in this context of mathematical crisis that Russell's student, Ludwig Wittgenstein, began his philosophical work.
His philosophical journey, mirroring the broader evolution in our understanding of definition, is typically divided into two distinct periods.
His early period, culminating in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, sought to perfect the logical project of his mentors.
He attempted to establish a purely formal relationship between language and reality.
His later period, marked by Philosophical Investigations, represents a dramatic break from this tradition.
This shift emerged from his growing conviction that formal systems of definition were fundamentally flawed, and that meaning could only be understood through social and cultural contexts.
He came to see that words derive their meaning not from formal definitions but from their use within specific communities or "neighborhoods" of meaning.
Through his concept of language games, Wittgenstein effectively proposed what we might call a topological model of meaning, where the definition of a term depends on its position within a web of social practices and linguistic customs.
This shift from the mathematical to the contextual marks a crucial turning point in the philosophy of language, fundamentally altering our understanding of what it means to define something.

Concurrently with Wittgenstein's development of his contextual theory of meaning, Ferdinand de Saussure was independently formulating a parallel understanding through his revolutionary work in semiotics.
His central contribution, the bilateral sign, separated a word's surface form (the signifier) from what it represents (the signified).
Crucially, Saussure demonstrated that this relationship is arbitrary; there is no natural connection between a word and its concept.
This arbitrariness shifts focus from individual signs to their relationships within a broader system.
Because the relationship between a signifier and a signified is arbitrary, signifiers are endowed with meaning purely as a result of their relationship with a broader social context.

The empirical evidence for a relational theory of language emerges most clearly in phonetics.
Dialect continua demonstrate how language features gradually shift across geographic space, with each local variant being mutually intelligible with its neighbors while distant variants become increasingly distinct.
The wave model of language change reveals how linguistic innovations spread through communities like ripples in a pond, transforming the relationships between signs as they propagate.
These patterns of continuous variation and gradual transformation reveal language as a dynamic system where meaning exists in relationships rather than fixed points.
The presence of these smooth transitions between dialects provides concrete evidence for the topological nature of linguistic meaning that Saussure and Wittgenstein theorized.

The implications of Saussure's work would be taken up by a new generation of French theorists, beginning with Jacques Lacan.
Lacan's reinterpretation of the bilateral sign rejected the notion of signifiers being attached to one signified.
Instead, he emphasized slippage, a process by which the significand evolves as signifiers continually defer meaning by referring to other signifiers in an endless chain.
To deal with the implications of slippage, Lacan would come to view language as a high velocity process; an insight would profoundly influence his students, including F√©lix Guattari.

Guattari, in his collaboration with Gilles Deleuze, would push this process theory of language to its logical conclusion.
Rather than approaching the task of definition by asking "what does a word mean?" they instead ask "what does the word do?" Their assertion that linguistics is fundamentally pragmatics represents the complete inversion of the Platonic project.
Instead of seeking timeless definitions, they propose understanding language through its effects and operations in specific contexts.
Moreover, they see the process that language carries out as transcending the realm of signifiers and acting on the physical world.
Words, in their view, are not containers of meaning but tools that perform actions; they create connections, establish territories, and generate possibilities.

Now that we are equipped with a Deleuzoguattarian framework of meaning, we can return to our central task of defining x by asking ‚Äúwhat does x do?‚Äù In the particular social context of this essay, any definition of x primarily has the effect of amusing Brandon Duderstadt and eliciting some reaction from Anton Alyakin and Vivian Lee.
This essay itself is therefore a suitable definition of x, as it has certainly amused Brandon, and it will undoubtedly evoke a reaction from Anton and Vivian.

The definition of üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, however, is a different story entirely.
