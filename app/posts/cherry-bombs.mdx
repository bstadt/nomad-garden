# Aphorisms

<ResonantDensity text="Grow your ontology! cognitive botany"/>

 - Inaction is an action.
 - Rigid systems lack the magic. Seek the patterns in the static.
 - Relative perceptions of the time commodity cause dishonest tardiness constantly.
 - Grow your ontology with cognitive botany.
 - Utils: Who tills? YOU till!
 - Default position: existence is imposition.
 - Opulence often opts for profit.
 - Oligopoly? Honestly not for me. It's gotta be all of us steering this probably.
 - Pass on a salary! Hack haphazard gadgetry! Atlas was that for me.
 - A man manifesting a plan: sans manifesto.
 - Pan from the resonance nuggets of common sense, prophesies, promises, pockets of lawlessness, cosmic agglomerant!
