# Cherry Bombs
A cherry bomb is the result of a word game where you try to convey an image in a short [assonantly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assonance) dense phrase.
Examples include:
 - Pan from the assonance nuggets of common sense, prophesies, promises, pockets of lawlessness, cosmic agglomerant!
 - Inaction is an action.
 - Rigid systems lack the magic, seek the patterns in the static.
 - Relative perceptions of the time commodity cause dishonest tardiness constantly.
 - Opulence often opts for profit.
 - Utils: Who tills? YOU till!
 - A man manifesting a plan sans manifesto.
 - Function with something like presumption of gumption when head hunting at your elbow rubbing luncheon.
 - Default position: to exist is imposition.
 - Pass on a salary! Hack haphazard gadgetry! Atlas was that for me.
 - Oligopoly? Honestly not for me. It's gotta be all of us steering this probably.
