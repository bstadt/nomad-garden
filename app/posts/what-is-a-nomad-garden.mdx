# What is a Nomad Garden?
The nomad garden is a combination of the ideas of the Body without Organs and the war machine, as they are presented in [A Thousand Plateaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Thousand_Plateaus) (ATP).

## The Body Without Organs
The most succinct definition I can give for the Body without Organs (BwO) is the limit of the deterritorialization process.
Deterritorialization is the process of breaking down barriers, distinctions, dichotomies, strata, etc., and the BwO is the limit that this process approaches.
Concretely, it evokes the image of the egg, which is then organ-ized (pun credit to [Brent Adkins](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=a3SrMloAAAAJ&hl=en)) as it develops into an animal.

The BwO is introduced in Chapter 6 of ATP, which is titled **November 28, 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?**
Putting aside ATP's convention of dating chapter names for a later discussion, I found it interesting that the title is posed as the question of how one might become a BwO.
For a person, becoming-BwO would entail an increase in potential and a loosening of constraints.
As someone operating in a highly constrained environment, I certainly found this desirable.
Luckily, Deleuze and Guattari provide instructions for how becoming-BwO can be achieved:

> "This is how it should be done: Lodge yourself on a stratum, experiment
> with the opportunities it offers, find an advantageous place on it, find
> potential movements of deterritorialization, possible lines of flight,
> experience them, produce flow conjunctions here and there, try out
> continuums of intensities segment buy segment, **have a small plot of new
> land at all times**"

Deleuze & Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus* (161)

The garden in nomad.garden refers to this small plot of land.
My hope is that the site acts like a digital garden, wherein new ideas and lines of flight can be explored and nourished.

## Tretise on Nomadology - The War Machine

> "Axiom 1: The war machine is exterior to the State apparatus."

Deleuze & Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus* (351)

> "Axiom 2: The war machine is the invention of the nomads."

Deleuze & Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus* (380)

The most succinct definition I can give for the war machine is the vector along which deterritorialization occurs.
If the BwO is a limit, the war machine is the direction we must travel in to get there, and the nomad is who become when we begin the journey.
As such, this garden is a nomadic one.

## Spurious Connections
There are also several spurious connections that encouraged me to have nomad in the name.
For one, I've always been enamored with the symbol of the nomad - so much so that I named my [undergraduate research project](http://evadyer.github.io/NIPS-bigneuro-2017.html) Neurodata's Opensource Method for Autonomous Detection of Synapses (a [backronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym) for NOMADS).
I'm also a fan of the nom morpheme (NOMic), and like to introduce it wherever I can to maximize the [paronymic attraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paronymic_attraction) between the signs in my life.
