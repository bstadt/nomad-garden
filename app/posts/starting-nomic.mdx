## Movement Composition: Starting Nomic

<RemoteVideo src="https://bstadt-bucket.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/compositions/you_have_to_jump.mp4"/>

This composition shows my progression towards the most difficult stunt I've ever done.

There are 4 complicating factors to this jump:
1) The short run up only gives me two steps before my takeoff step, so I have to generate power quickly.
2) The takeoff requires a step up to a thin wall, so I need to be doubly careful about my foot placement.
3) The far wall is not structurally sound enough for me to land on, so I have to clear it.
4) The buildings are ~60 feet tall, so if I fall I die.

I filmed the majority of my prep as well as two completions of the jump itself.

The top left panel shows prep work I did to become comfortable approaching the step up.
This was done to both gather information about how the step up would feel and to build psychological confidence.

The top right panel shows perp work I did on the entire jump.
One of the reasons I chose this jump in particular was because of the nearby ideal prep setup
The prep included a similar run up and allowed me to easily mark the jump distance.

The bottom left panel shows me breaking the jump.
This is the only time I've filmed my first success of a roof gap.
I am generally opposed to filming your first completion of a high consequence stunt, since it introduces an element of "doing it for the camera."
However, I often find great joy looking back at parkour footage, and wanted to capture my reaction after breaking a roof gap at least once.

The bottom right panel shows me doing the jump a second time.
I generally find that, once a jump is broken, I can do it over and over and over again.
I think this is because repetition is so present in the way that I train parkour.
I often spend an entire session repeatedly performing the same line.

I only ended up doing this particular gap twice, because after the second jump, I had a realization.

At this point in my life, I had been working on [Atlas](https://atlas.nomic.ai/) prototypes for several months in my spare time.
I was frustrated that my full time job kept me from spending more time working on it.
I had been playing with the idea of leaving my job and focusing on Atlas, but I was still apprehensive.
After the second jump, the following line of thinking hit me:
- I have effectively been "prepping" for the "jump" from my job by working on Atlas prototypes.
- If I want to break the "jump", it is inevitable that I will have to move on from the "prep work".
- I have just broken this physical jump, which I've been working towards for a while. I need a new "jump" to break. Leaving my job could be that "jump."
- If I'm serious about "jumping" to Atlas full time, I should probably stop jumping across rooftops.

At this point, I collected my drone and climbed back down the side of the building.
I have not done a roof gap since.
I was self-employed a 3 months later.
Nomic raised a seed 6 months later.
Nomic raised a series A 16 months later.
