  - Interesting things this week
    - Executive order seems like a win for incumbents
        - This is serious threat to democratic AI
        - Nomic should start thinking about how democratic AI fits into the regulatory landscape
    - Idefics blog post
        - It would be amazing to rip one off charts from selections of the data
        - Liquid interface - generate vis code on the fly - i can generally do in a few shots in colab
            - Integrate into the interface, allow users to save views
        - Should be hack weekable
        - We name Christopher Kennedy in the blog post
            - CARL SOLOMON! IM WITH YOU IN ROCKLAND!
            - i should reach out to the family and see if we can get the atlas image on his memory wall
            - would also make a great tie in to the idea of simulacra being summoned from the machine
            - this is similar to ATP refrain, and the idea of reincarnation in buddhism
                - adam would prob have much to say about this
            - pop in on maps is massively annoying
                - search should return any tiles where the regex matches
    - Nomic X HF community art sale
    - WE HAVE MAPPED THE TOP DATASETS ON HF
        - That would be sick swag - trading cards, one of each dataset
        - Keep science open link on the back
    - Managing is hard
      - martial arts was a very intense, disciplined regime
        - i dont want nomic to be that, but that is how i was managed as a child
      - im very bad at expressing unhappiness quietly - i have to get better at that
      - perhaps walking the line between happiness and discipline is the fundamental challenge of management
        - no one is happy if you make them do push ups
  - can we do more work with the frenchman?

 - In the pineapple scene, wittgenstein is demonstrating differential transmission of a message based on way of life
     - If the student is gay, he may pick up on the reason wittgenstein is using the word queer to refer to the pineapple
     - If he is not, he may not understand that the words queer and pineapple are overcoded
     - The reception of the message differs based on sexual orientation, which makes it practical.
        - it might be how wittgenstein discerns potential romantic partners in a hostile environment. its passing messages in plain sight.
 - paige said that nomic was rhizomatic because it had lines of communication below the hierarchy
     - this is a great answer and speaks to the botanical analogy
     - follow up - how do you think nomic's structure of communication lines affects how the entity behaves?
 - a room full of epsilon bubbles
    - if agency meets facticity at epsilon
    - and our universe is bounded (perhaps by the speed of light)
    - we are in a room packed full of epsilon bubbles
    - and the bubbles can merge or pop or grow and consume each other
    - and one of them has our name
    - how big should we blow it?
    - how small should we let it get?
    - what shape should it be
    - (the bubbles in this room come in all shapes and sizes, for we don't know the metric that makes them spheres!)
    - should we pop it?
    - can we pop it?
    - perhaps when they pop they make a sound
    - which echos through the room
    - causing other bubbles to pop and merge and misbehave
    - but after a while (assuming friction)
    - there isn't any sound left

 - Paige found this [paper](https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/sciadv.1501158)
   - Uses a kernel function called symbolic transfer entropy that ive never heard of
   - finds that the matrix goes from hierarchical to fully connected during coordinated social events
    - literally deterritorializing a regime of signs
    - draws an explicit connection to brain connectivity
 - Would be cool to have the blog be paper themed, or like, softer
  - the elements of euclid cover color scheme seems right

 - Went out and did a bunch of parkour today, for the first time in a while, all street level
    - Warmed up on rocks in central park
        - The rocks were not as interesting as I thought they would be
    - Precision sideflip and flow lines near lincoln center
        - Kong -> Tak -> Side Flip -> Mount Full
    - At high school directly west
        - Kong Pre -> Dive Kong -> Cart Full
    - Northwest of high school, just south of parkour park
        - 10 ft wide 3 ft drop standing pre, was able to get several sticks
        - Process involved many near overshoots
            - I bias towards overshoot on my pres to protect my ankles
 - Also formalizing the time space tradeoff blogpost
    - Relation between single core processing and relativity came up in hamming's [book](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning/dp/1732265178)
    - Made a bunch of progress after thinking about it all day and writing.
    - It took me a bunch of tries to get the flow right, but im happy with how the structure turned out
        - I was originally aiming for a less technical audience, but didn't want to write another tutorial on big O, so now the post assumes some familiarity with algorithms


## Sep 30 2023
 - A few minor blog updates today.
    - The random walk is centered in the canvas now.
    - Fonts now seem to be broken for some reason.
    - Also I need to track down the incredibly annoying click sometimes doesnt click issue.
        - Hypothesis is that its related to my use client directive on the landing
        - The link thing seems to go away after I click something for the first time
        - This whole use client thing seems like a great idea in theory but is such a pain in practice


## Sep 25 2023
 - Stuck in PGH airport trying to get back to NYC
 - The hardest problems at Nomic continue to be people problems
    - As you scale a startup, the number of person-person interactions grows quadriatically
    - The number of groups of people scales combinatorically
    - People are less pleasant to engineer than bits
        - Behavioral variance is high, and there is no peopleCI
        - This makes people problems very tough to debug
        - People often dont follow the instructions you give them
            - This is almost always unintentional
            - A particularly hard problem to debug is when they intentionally dont follow instructions you give them
        - Striking a balance between being friends with people and being their boss is hard
            - Not sure which case is harder:
                - When you are the same age as your employee
                    - Challenging because default mode is friends
                - When you are significantly younger than your employee
                    - Challenging because default authority structure is switched

    - The role of the CEO
       - High growth handbook
        - "Realize your old patterns of work can no longer apply"
        - "While you may be an excellent programmer, if your team now has 50 or 500 engineers, it is unlikely that writing code is the best thing you can contribute as CEO."
        - "It may be painful, but to scale your organization and move ahead as CEO you will likely need to let go of certain parts of your prior roles that you enjoyed or thought were important."
 - What is p(GPT4All moment)? What about p(GPT4All moment | founder market fit)? What about p(GPT4All moment | hacker)?
 - I suspect the skill I have with the highest z-score is 0-1 hacking.
  - I fucking love 0-1 hacking. I derive existential joy from the process of creating something fundamentally new.
    - This is critical for the positive feedback loop, the "manic addictive mode," that is required to 0-1 something beautiful.
  - I have the skill set to actually execute on all parts of my idea
    - My entire background (Botball, MLH, Neurodata, Rad AI, Nomic) is in time & resource constrained tech challenges
  - I am willing to move on to the next project once I get to 1
    - Once you get to 1, the "jump" is "broken," and the "manic addictive mode" ceases
  - Perhaps the best way for me to help Nomic is to do a bunch of 0-1 projects that build upon Nomic technology?
  - Perhaps the best way for me to help Nomic is to get leadership experience now so I make the heinous mistakes while we are still small.

 - Craving deep dish, maybe because of all the UChicago people at the [Patronus](https://www.patronus.ai/) event.
    - Only now realizing how hard it may be to get deep dish in NYC.
    - I need me a rebel pizzeria
 - Just pushed out the starting Nomic post
    - I'll likely add context to it over time
        - More on scouting locations
        - Getting information from the first person to break a gap
            - Benj talks about this in several storror videos
  - Removed the thumbnails from posts.
    - The MJ images felt gimmicky, it made clicking links slow
    - Im thinking of having the walks fade over time and having new walks trigger on mouseover
        - also have to fix the overflow on the caption div to prevent the canvas from jumping around
  - Picked up grapefruit by yoko ono today
    - Ive known about this book for a long time, and am realizing ive done a few of the compositions
        - There is one about touching a bunch of walls to really get a feel for them that ive certainly done, and could write at length about it
        - I think im going to start working through it and writing about the experience

        - Random art on landing
            - I like that it goes out of the box sometimes - change color based on if it makes it
                - There is a CLT thing here where you track every time the generation occurs and see how often it goes out of the box
                - Perhaps have some aspect of the color that evolves over time
                - Progressively disappearing scribbles in the background

## Sep 4 2023
 - Read [videofusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08320.pdf) over coffee this morning
    - The main idea is to factor the noise in the diffusion process into two parts: base noise and residual noise
    - Base noise captures the majority of the image content and style, while residual noise captures the motion in the video
    - Base noise is shared across consecutive frames in the video, residual noise is not
    - Their architecture consists of two models, a base diffusion model (~2B param) and a residual diffusion model (~500M param)
    - The base model can be pretrained, so a LORA'd backbone can be used
        - For best results, the paper suggests to tune the base and residual models jointly
    - Section 2.2 mentions a quantized auto encoder to autoregressive transformer approach to video generation. This is exactly the arch used by the meta [audiocraft](https://github.com/facebookresearch/audiocraft) models.
    - My intuition is that the decoupled architecture will provide a lot of opportunity for caching, which will be necessary if we want this to be live audioreactive
 - Finally got the math rendering on this site - it was harder than it neaded to be
    - Adding remark and rehype options to next.config.mjs did not work. perhaps related to [this](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-math/issues/71) issue.
    - Anyway, got it to work bu building a react component that renders latex and importing it in post files

## Sep 3 2023
 - [Post](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CwpmeMnIemI/) discussion with this.xor.that
    - post getting hate for stealing source work
        - steelman that data use is ok
            - the algorithm is a tool, like a brush. in the same way a painter may study or reproduce the style of an old master, so can the programmer behind the algorithm
            - [herbie hancock vibes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6QsusDS_8A)
        - steelman data use is not ok
            - the issue of access - what constitutes "consumption" or "inspiration"
            - the issue of compensation - artists will lose compensation if their art becomes primarily computational
        - current best idea
            - attribution
                - at the very least track what art is used to train what algorithm.
                - make this data public
                - this way, once a fair compensation structure is determined, it can be applied
    - this.xor.that is interested in an audioreactive diffusion video for livecode
        - try to replecate the post, but have the transition occur on the beat
        - similar to [kaiber.ai](https://kaiber.ai/)
        - step 1: generate video
            - brief search in coffee shop gave me this mvp approach- use a controlnet, and feed in the edges of the previous frame to get video
            - will likely start with huggingface diffusers for offline approach, then switch for inference optimization
            - [videofusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08320.pdf) seems promising, and has a hf diffusers [implementation](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/pipelines/text_to_video)
            - how hard will training a LORA be on this arch? would be a great way to fit to a particular vibe
                - there is a [blog post](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/training/lora) on it, but it only contains a text-to-image example.
                - adapting to video should be possible
        - it would be very interesting to fine tune on [keifergr33n](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rgjhBOOYGw) and [trappin in japan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JmJdUjCDBM)
            - its stylistically defined paired visual music data!
