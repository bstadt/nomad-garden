# WIP Top Media Picks

## Films
- Ex Machina - Directed by Alex Garland
- Wittgenstein - Directed by Derek Jarman
    - This 1993 art house film depicts the life of the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein as a stage play. The film is packed with jokes for students of philosophy (e.g. Bertrand Russel gets called out for taking too long to the point, Ludwig talks to an actual Martian about the meaning of words, John Meynard Keynes is costumed like the Joker).
- Scott Pilgrim vs The World - Directed by Edgar Wright
    - This 2010 film is a masterclass in visual comedy. It also boasts an ensemble cast including Michael Cera, Aubrey Plaza, Kieran Culkan, Brie Larson, Chris Evans, and Anna Kendrik. It is one of the first films to feature modern tricking in its fight scenes.
- The Menu - Directed by Mark Mylod
- Moonrise Kingdom - Directed by Wes Anderson

## Series
- Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
- Succession
- How To with John Wilson
- Community
- Cyberpunk Edgerunners

## Books
- Godel Escher Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
    - Hofstadter masterfully weaves together mathematics, art, music, literature, and humor in this book, which concerns itself with the question of the origin of consciousness. Adding to the intrigue, the book contains several self-refferential puzzles and easter eggs.
- A Thousand Plateaus by Gilles Deleuze \& Felix Guattari
    - A Thousand Plateaus is equal parts revelatory and impenetrable. Dense with reverences to 1970's French intellectual culture, A Thousand Plateaus concerns itself with the implications of the rhizome (an ever-evolving interconnected fabric that underlies reality) on linguistics, psychoanalysis, ethics, politics, and sociology.
- The Idiot by Elif Batuman
    - This semi-autobiographical novel follows Selin, a freshman linguistics student at Harvard trying to make sense of both language and the world around her. The narrator's bone dry observational humor perfectly balances the existentially angsty subject matter.
- Ham on Rye by Charles Bukowski
    - This semi-autobiographical novel follows Hank, who reminds me of my father.
- Atlas Shrugged by Ayn Rand
    - Among the most misunderstood books in modern culture, Atlas Shrugged advocates for a freedom so radical you might just mistake Ayn Rand for a French Existentialist.
