<mark>RBYT</mark> MANIFESTO
1st <mark>(ONLY)</mark> Draft
<mark>(REVEALED WISDOM)</mark>

<mark>We shit on schoolmasters & police.
We sneer at</mark> liberationists
<mark>ideologues
and we avoid well lit rooms.</mark>


<mark>We</mark> be topological <mark>charlatan
in your corridors,
abandoned parks
Ambush-decor</mark>

Each of us holds half the map!
Seams of our <mark>city-</mark> state blur in our
<mark>sweat.</mark>

Words <mark>belong to those who steal them back</mark>
So
<mark>We be thieves</mark>

<mark>We are bored by equal opportunity employment</mark>
We <mark>do not</mark> work <mark>for a living</mark>

We do not complain
We <mark>do not</mark> explain
<mark>We love black</mark>
We admire <mark>tropicalisimo, sabotage
Greaf
Breakin
Fancy & </mark> imagination

<mark>Unbridled play,
Embracing disorder as
Wellspring of style
And
Storehouse</mark>

We are interested in <mark>returning</mark>
Reconnecting <mark>
Poetry to </mark> the body <mark>
Therefore
Poetry is set to music
By virtue of efficacy</mark>

W<mark>e are poets who approach the craft as crime
N</mark>o<mark>t against bodies
But ideas</mark>

We advocate <mark>exemplary crime
Aesthetic crime
Crimes of love </mark>

Action and thus <mark>art
By spontaneous nature</mark>

<mark>We act as free. We are what we pretend to be</mark>
We calculate the odds <mark>, step out, smoke
Eat, drink, think </mark> and speak <mark>
Avoiding the crossfire
Byt taking the risk to dance before we calcify!!</mark>

We<mark>know to</mark> unveil <mark>oneself is to be declared heretic
Exiled by society</mark>

<mark> And yet we reject martyrdom
</mark> symbolic <mark>pain</mark>

<mark>We accept criminality </mark>
Civilization <mark> owns all leases so we must trespass
We accept the outskirts </mark>
We refuse <mark> a thin survival while </mark> waiting on revolution
<mark>Our muses manifest themselves on verboten ground</mark>

Artist as <mark> criminal</mark>

<mark>Our </mark> model <mark>is the child-gang, or
The bank robber band
Money is a lie </mark>
This quest is
Possible
<mark>Without it</mark>
