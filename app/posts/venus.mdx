# Sonnet for Venus

Amidst the night, a sailor out to sea,  
is fast asleep atop a map of stars.  
He meets the goddess Venus in his dream.  
She softly lays her head atop his heart.  

Before the dawn the sailor wakes to find  
the Morning Star is somehow set apart!  
She disregards the path the maps defined,  
proceeding by a different astral chart.  

So day by day the sailor wakes with glee  
to learn from how she’s rearranged his skies.  
As star and sailor form a harmony,  
her movements and his maps become aligned.  
 
Through cosmic dance the pair is intertwined:  
two halves that meet at one horizon line.
